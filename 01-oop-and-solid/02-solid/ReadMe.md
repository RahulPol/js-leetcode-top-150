**Overview**
The SOLID design principles are a set of five principles for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable software. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin
and are widely used in object-oriented programming to guide developers in creating well-structured and robust code. The SOLID acronym stands for:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
This principle encourages the division of functionality into separate classes or modules, each responsible for a specific task.
It leads to code that is easier to understand, test, and maintain.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Instead of modifying existing code to add new features, the principle suggests extending the code through inheritance, interfaces, or other mechanisms.
This allows you to add new functionality without changing the existing codebase, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
This principle ensures that objects of derived classes should be able to replace objects of the base class without causing unexpected behavior.
It promotes polymorphism and helps maintain consistency in object-oriented hierarchies.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
This principle advises against creating large, monolithic interfaces and instead encourages the creation of smaller, focused interfaces tailored to specific client requirements.
It prevents clients from being burdened with methods they don't need, promoting a cleaner and more efficient design.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
This principle advocates the use of interfaces and abstract classes to define the interaction between high-level and low-level components, reducing coupling and increasing flexibility.

Applying the SOLID principles helps developers create software that is easier to understand, maintain, and extend. By adhering to these principles, you can build code that is more modular, adaptable, and less prone to errors, making it a valuable foundation for scalable and robust software applications.
