// The Adapter pattern allows us to access the functionality of an object using a
// different interface.

// A real-life example of an adapter would be a device that allows you to plug a USB
// Type-A cable into a USB Type-C port. In a generic sense, an adapter converts an
// object with a given interface so that it can be used in a context where a different
// interface is expected.
