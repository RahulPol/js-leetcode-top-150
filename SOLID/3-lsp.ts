// 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):

// Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
// This principle ensures that objects of derived classes can replace objects of the base class without causing unexpected behavior.
// It promotes polymorphism and helps maintain consistency in object-oriented hierarchies.
