// 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):

// High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
// Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
// This principle advocates the use of interfaces and abstract classes to define the interaction between high-level and low-level components,
// reducing coupling and increasing flexibility.
