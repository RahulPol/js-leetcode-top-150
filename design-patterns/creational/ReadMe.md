In this chapter, in particular, we'll take a look at a class of design patterns called creational. As the name suggests, these patterns address problems related to the creation of objects. For example, the Factory pattern allows us to encapsulate the creation of an object within a function. The Revealing Constructor pattern allows usto expose private object properties and methods only during the object's creation, while the Builder pattern simplifies the creation of complex objects. Finally, theSingleton pattern and the Dependency Injection pattern help us with wiring the modules within our applications.
