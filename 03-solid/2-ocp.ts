// Open-Close Principle
// Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
// Instead of modifying existing code to add new features, the principle suggests extending the code through inheritance, interfaces, or other mechanisms.
// This allows you to add new functionality without changing the existing codebase, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.
